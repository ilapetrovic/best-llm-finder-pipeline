    "# Building an Agentic RAG System with Open-Source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer complex questions from a long document. Instead of relying on a traditional vector database, we will employ a multi-agent, hierarchical approach where LLM-powered agents navigate the document's structure dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful for dense, lengthy texts like legal manuals, research papers, or financial reports, where context is spread across many pages. Our system will mimic how a human researcher would work: first skimming for relevant sections, then drilling down into specific paragraphs, and finally synthesizing an answer based only on the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features of this Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Zero-Ingestion:** The system can work with new documents instantly without any pre-processing or embedding steps.\n",
    "2.  **Dynamic Retrieval:** The LLM itself decides which parts of the document are relevant, allowing it to handle paraphrased or conceptual questions more effectively.\n",
    "3.  **Traceability:** The system provides precise, paragraph-level citations for every part of its answer, ensuring verifiability.\n",
    "4.  **Customizable:** The entire workflow is built to be compatible with open-source LLMs accessible through OpenAI-compatible APIs."

    "This notebook has demonstrated an end-to-end agentic RAG workflow using customizable, open-source LLMs. By employing a hierarchical navigation strategy and a multi-step qualitative evaluation, we can tackle complex questions in long documents with high precision and full traceability, all without the overhead of a traditional vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Agents Offer Control:** Breaking the problem into specialized agents (Router, Synthesizer, Evaluator) provides greater control and allows for the use of different models optimized for each task.\n",
    "2.  **Hierarchical Navigation is Powerful:** This approach effectively narrows down a vast search space, mimicking human-like research patterns.\n",
    "3.  **LLM-based Evaluation is Crucial:** Moving beyond simple operational metrics to assess faithfulness and relevance is key to building trustworthy and reliable AI systems.\n",
    "4.  **Comprehensive Analysis:** Consolidating operational and qualitative metrics into a final summary provides a clear, holistic view of system performance for each query."
